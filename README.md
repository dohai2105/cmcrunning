### Back end
I used strava API to get running data of my friends that made by PHP Lavarel

### Front end
I have just learnt Vuejs for fun, so I used it to display information.
In my opinion, Vuejs is simple, easy to learn. I have a plan to learn React js and Go after I finish AWS Certified Developer Associate
